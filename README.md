# GRB_Synchrotron
Here I upload the code I am currently writing during my Bachelor's Thesis: "A theoretical study of spectral evolution in GRB 211211A". It is not complete yet, I hope to upload the final version in February 2025.
The main aim of this project is to create a simple Synchrotron emission model to describe the spectrum of GRB 211211A during prompt emission.
